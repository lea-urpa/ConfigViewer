config-viewer
Interactive method for simultaneously viewing single-snp manhattan plots alongside FINEMAP results, with graphical representation of the most probable causal SNP configurations. You can plot one to three manhattan plots, simultaneously viewing single-snp, FINEMAP, and conditional results. For viewing manhattan plots with color-coded correlation to the top SNP, you may upload either the .z file and .ld file used for FINEMAPing, or a correlations data frame with columns 'rsid' and 'corr'. For large LD matrices, creating this correlations data frame will speed up plot
